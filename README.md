this is a simple project but it solves a major problem
many times the retailers face problem and get scammed by some fake advices about stocks so these is just a simple but valueable idea to aware or guide the retailers

procedure to use an web app
1. just enter the details as stated check the stock fundamentals on sceener and tickertape and enter here in website
2. the web check out all data and decide whether to invest or not
3. done

how it works
it works in real time i have used varibale shr for it it is based on credit system if the entered detailas are good then the final score will be higher which says good stock
and if it is avg it says it is a moderate risk stock
and in worst case if it is low it says stay away from these stock
all the connections are there between main logic like it will check whether assetts and liablilities mismatch , pe and eps ratios , promotor holding and also divident stock or not based on it it gives rating
